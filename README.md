# AFKfix_1.0
Sources for AFKfix v1.0 mouse jiggler

AFKfix is inspired by Digispark: http://digistump.com/products/1

AFKfix and Digispark use the Micronucleus bootloader: https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus

AFKfix uses the Micronucleus bootloader to make an Arduino compatible USB dongle that emulates a mouse 
or keyboard. The Arduino code provided was originally used to prevent Windows locking the user out of the 
desktop, by emulating a mouse and "moving" the mouse by less than one pixel, then moving it back again.
This movement should be invisible to the user.

All material in this repo is provided as-is. Have fun!
